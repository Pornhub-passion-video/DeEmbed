\section{Introduction}
DeEmbed is a GUI application that can read raw S-Parameter files in TouchStone format There is support for 1 to 4 port s-parameter files. The s-parameters can be de-embedded using the SOLTI (Short, Open, Load, Through, Isolation) method. If you create 1 or 2 port s-parameter files from your cables (through + isolation) and measure 1-port s-parameter files of a short, open and load, the original DUT can be shown in the different graphs as if they were measured without cables.

By default the application shows the data in a smith chart, but different charts are supported (Db, phase, magnitude, VSWR, polar and some combinations).

The application automatically interpolates (spline) the calibration sets to the desired touchstone file. Note that the frequency range of the first touchstone file is leading, any file loaded afterwards will also be interpolated.
